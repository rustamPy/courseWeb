 <!-- Course Format and Structure --> 
 <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i> Course Format and Structure: </h4> 
 <p> 
     The course is conducted entirely online through the Slack platform. The lessons will be hands-on and 
     highly engaging and interactive. One group will have <b> maximum 5 students </b>. 
     Each lesson has a duration of approximately <b> 50 minutes </b>, which is roughly equivalent to one 
     hour, 
     <b>twice per week</b>. 
     The Core IT - Intermediate course typically spans a period of <b>6 months</b>, although the exact 
     duration may vary 
     from one student to another. 
     The primary difference between the Intermediate and Entry levels of Core IT lies in the fact that I 
     will skip the fundamental aspects of general IT and dive straight into advanced technologies that are 
     currently in use. I will illustrate how the world of IT is constructed and emphasize the essential 
     knowledge required. 
     Each student will receive <b> personalized </b> attention and support throughout the course.
