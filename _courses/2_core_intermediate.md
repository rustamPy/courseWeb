 <!-- Course Overview -->
<h4><i class="fa-regular fa-eye" style="color: #000000;"></i> Course Overview: </h4>
<p>
    The concept of an IT entry-level position may not be applicable in the traditional sense. At
    this age, the focus
    should be on
    <b> introducing children to basic computer literacy and technology concepts</b>
    in a
    fun and engaging manner.
    Some suitable activities and learning experiences for a kid to explore the world of IT
    include:
</p>

        applications, use a keyboard, mouse and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Internet Safety: I will educate about
        <b> online safety</b>
        , responsible internet use, and the
        potential risks associated with sharing personal information online.
    </li>
    <li>Coding Games: Introduce you
        <b> coding</b>
        through games and interactive platforms like
        Scratch, Code.org, or Tynker, where you can create simple animations and games.

    </li>

        keyboard, and mouse, and explain their functions.

        like Paint or other kid-friendly digital
        art platforms to spark your creativity.

        <b> educational</b>
        apps and interactive content
