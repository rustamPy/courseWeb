            <p>
                The concept of an IT entry-level position may not be applicable in the traditional sense. At
                this age, the focus
                should be on
                <mark> introducing children to basic computer literacy and technology concepts</mark>
                in a
                fun and engaging manner.
                Some suitable activities and learning experiences for a kid to explore the world of IT
                include:

            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> Instructor Information: </h4>
            <p> Rustam Karimov </p>

            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i> Course Format and Structure: </h4>
            <p>
                The course is conducted entirely online through the Slack platform.
                Each lesson has a duration of approximately 50-60 minutes, which is roughly equivalent to one hour,
                twice per week.
                The Core IT - Entry course typically spans a period of 4-5 months, although the exact duration may vary
                from one student to another.
                The student's ability to complete the course more rapidly than their peers enables them to progress to a
                higher-level group or course such as Core IT - Intermediate.
            </p>

            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Learning Objectives: </h4>
            <p>
                <b>Basic Hardware Proficiency:</b> Students will be able to identify, install, and troubleshoot common
                computer
                hardware components, such as CPUs, RAM, hard drives, and peripherals.
                <br>
                <b> Software Application Usage: </b> Students will effectively use a variety of software applications,
                including
                word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software, for everyday tasks.
                <br>

            </p>
            <h4> <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i> Course Materials and Resources: </h4>
            <p> Given that the lessons will be held online, as previously mentioned, course materials will be accessible
                through
                screen sharing. These materials consist of PowerPoint presentations that are regularly updated with the
                latest information. The key essentials for students will include owning a laptop and having a notebook
                at their disposal. The software they are going to use during lessons will be absolutely free to use.</p>

            <h4> <i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> Assessment and Grading: </h4>
            <p><b> Quizzes: </b> (every 2 weeks) Regular quizzes will be administered to assess students' comprehension
                of course material and
                to reinforce key concepts. These quizzes will typically cover recent topics and serve as a form of
                ongoing assessment.
                <br>
                <b>Assignments: </b> (every 4 weeks) Assignments will be assigned periodically to allow students to
                apply their knowledge and
                skills to real-world scenarios. These assignments may include practical tasks, research projects, or
                problem-solving exercises.
                <br>
                <b>Examinations: </b> (at the end of each major part) There will be periodic examinations or tests that
                evaluate students' understanding of
                broader course sections. These may include mid-term and final exams covering multiple topics. </p>
