            <p>
                The concept of an IT entry-level position may not be applicable in the traditional sense. At
                this age, the focus
                should be on
                <b> introducing children to basic computer literacy and technology concepts</b>
                in a
                fun and engaging manner.
                Some suitable activities and learning experiences for a kid to explore the world of IT
                include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Basic Computer Skills: I will teach how to use a computer, navigate the desktop, open
                    applications, use a keyboard, mouse and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internet Safety: I will educate about
                    <b> online safety</b>
                    , responsible internet use, and the
                    potential risks associated with sharing personal information online.
                </li>
                <li>Coding Games: Introduce you
                    <b> coding</b>
                    through games and interactive platforms like
                    Scratch, Code.org, or Tynker, where you can create simple animations and games.

                </li>
                <li>Computer Hardware: I will show the components of a computer, such as the CPU, monitor,
                    keyboard, and mouse, and explain their functions.
                </li>
                <li>Digital Art: Introduction to
                    <b> creative tools</b>
                    like Paint or other kid-friendly digital
                    art platforms to spark your creativity.
                </li>
                <li>Educational Apps: Encourage you to explore
                    <b> educational</b>
                    apps and interactive content
                    that promote learning in various subjects.
                </li>
                ...and
                <b> many more</b>
            </ol>

            <!-- Course Format and Structure -->
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i> Course Format and Structure: </h4>
            <p>
                The course is conducted entirely online through the Slack platform. The lessons will be hands-on and
                highly engaging and interactive. One group will have <b> maximum 5 students </b>.
                Each lesson has a duration of approximately <b> 50-60 minutes </b>, which is roughly equivalent to one
                hour,
                <b>twice per week</b>.
                The Core IT - Entry course typically spans a period of <b>4-5 months</b>, although the exact duration
                may vary
                from one student to another.
                <u> The student's ability to complete the course more rapidly than their peers enables them to progress
                    to a
                    higher-level group or course such as Core IT - Intermediate </u>.
                Each student will receive <b> personalized </b> attention and support throughout the course.
            </p>

            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i> Course Materials and Resources: </h4>
            <p> Given that the lessons will be held online, as previously mentioned, course materials will be accessible
                through
                screen sharing. These materials consist of PowerPoint presentations that are regularly updated with the
                latest information. The <b> key essentials for students will include owning a laptop and having a
                    notebook </b>
                at their disposal. The <b> software </b> they are going to use during lessons will be absolutely <b>
                    free </b> to use.</p>

            <!-- Assessment and Grading -->
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> Assessment and Grading: </h4>
            <p><b> Quizzes: </b> (every 2 weeks) Regular quizzes will be administered to assess students' comprehension
                of course material and
                to reinforce key concepts. These quizzes will typically cover recent topics and serve as a form of
                ongoing assessment.
