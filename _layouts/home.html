                                <p>Hello there, I am Rustam Karimov, a driven and versatile individual with a
                                    background
                                    in teaching Computer Science and a strong foothold in the world of software
                                    engineering. My journey in the tech industry began with a passion for computer
                                    programming, which eventually led me to pursue a career that <i> combines both
                                        education and cutting-edge software development. </i>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    <b> I started my professional journey as an educator,</b> sharing my enthusiasm for
                                    Computer Science with aspiring learners. Teaching has always been a rewarding
                                    experience for me. <i> Guiding students, breaking down complex topics into
                                        understandable pieces, and witnessing their growth as they developed
                                        programming
                                        skills brought me immense joy and fulfillment </i>. My time as a Computer

                                    Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to apply my skills in real-world
                                    scenarios, I transitioned into the role of a Software Engineer. Joining the

                                    Beyond my work at UBS, I remain

                                    <li>Courses you took, don't merely skim the surface of its concepts. Instead, you
                                        dive deep into each topic, providing in-depth explanations that empowers
                                        you with a profound understanding of the language's intricacies.

                                        students with the tools to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
